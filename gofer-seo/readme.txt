== Description ==

So, why Gofer SEO?

**Gofer**: An employee whose duties include running errands for other people. Derives from "Go and Fetch".

As a result, the main focus of this plugin is...

* Quality Work: To provide the best results and reduce the workload.
* Be Optimal: Performance with speed in mind.
* Extensive: Similar to someone you'd depend on to "go for coffee" or "go for donuts", Gofer SEO is designed to be extensive and dev friendly.

## General
Control what content renders SEO data, including support for custom post types & taxonomies. As well as the text and format of title & descriptions to help visitors see a glimpse before navigating to the website. If you have many posts/pages, you have the option to generate a description & keywords.

This also includes general support for Google Analytics, and website verification (Google, Bing, Pinterest, Yandex, & Baidu).

## Social Media

Additional settings to use specifically for social websites like Facebook & Twitter. Allows you to control how articles are displayed on social sites, as well as any other sites that utilize Open Graph.

## XML Sitemap

Adds an RSS & News Sitemap, and additional support to WP Sitemaps giving you full control what content is provided, the data that is provided, and how it is provided.

Built consistently with WP's XML Sitemaps Functionality and as an extension to the Core Sitemaps. This makes it easier to adapt to change and provide a familiarity that other developers could easily understand.

## Schema Graph

Currently, adds essential support for Schema graphs to add for content to stand out more in search results. Gofer SEO still provides a rich standard to post/pages, and will further expand on this.

## Crawlers

Allows you to give crawlers more of a directive where and where not to go. Most crawlers respect these rules to help improve their results, but please note, not all crawlers will. Which is why it's also possible to blacklist certain User-Agents if need be.

## Development

Plugin was developed with 10+ years of experience in WordPress & SEO, so development has an intuitive understanding of WordPress and its practices. WP Standards are followed to provide both a solid plugin and a dev friendly environment.
